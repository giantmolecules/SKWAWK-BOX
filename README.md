# SKWAWK-BOX

The DIY Broadcast Skwawk-Box

Current WORKING board is V4

Use a 1/32" Flat End Mill to machine board

Use a custom trace clearance of 1mm or greater. It will otherwise be more difficult to solder.

Save the leftover FR-1 material. It can be used for a microphone PCB.

There's an STL file here for a knob for the control panel's potentiometers. Untested as of yet. Will try to print in the ioLab...
